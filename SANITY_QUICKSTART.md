# Sanity Integration Removed

This repository previously included integration with Sanity CMS (Studio, client, and GROQ queries).

All Sanity-related functionality has been removed or replaced with safe stubs to avoid runtime errors.

If you previously relied on the Sanity integration, consider one of the following options:

- Reintroduce a headless CMS of your choice and implement data fetching accordingly.
- Migrate content to a different CMS or a static JSON/data source and update data fetching code.

If you want me to fully remove the remaining Sanity files or migrate content, tell me which option you'd prefer.
